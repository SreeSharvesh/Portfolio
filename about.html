								<h3>Hi, I'm Sree Sharvesh</h3>
								<p>As a passionate and driven pre-final year Computer Science student from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, India. I am deeply committed to the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity. My Academic journey has been enriched by hands-on projects, including the implementation of threshold secret sharing schemes and the creation of web applications. My strong foundation in programming and problem-solving skills enables me to tackle complex challenges and deliver effective solutions. I thrive on exploring new technologies and applying innovative solutions to real-world problems.</p>
								<p>Currently serving as a Software Engineering Fellow at Headstarter AI, I am gaining invaluable experience in developing cutting-edge software solutions. My interests extend to neural networks, deep learning, and DevOps, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Music is another passion of mine, fueling my creativity and providing balance to my technical pursuits. Open to collaboration, I am enthusiastic about working with like-minded individuals to push the boundaries of technology and achieve impactful results.</p>
